Final Project: Building a Modern Computer System from the Ground Up with NAND2Tetris
In this project, we implemented the NAND2Tetris program, a self-contained educational program aimed at teaching students how to build a modern computer system from the ground up. The program provides a hands-on, project-based approach to learning computer science and electronics engineering, starting with basic logic gates and building up to a complete computer system that can run software programs.

Throughout the project, we designed and implemented various components such as logic gates, arithmetic and logic units (ALUs), memory modules, and a CPU. We also created a low-level programming language and a compiler to translate higher-level code into machine language that can be executed on my custom-built computer system (Assembler).

By completing the project, we gained a deep understanding of how computers work and how the various components of a computer system work together to perform complex tasks. We also gained hands-on experience with software tools and hardware simulations, as well as skills in digital logic design, computer architecture, machine language programming, and operating systems.

In this repository, we have included all the necessary files and documentation for our custom-built computer system, including schematics, verilog codes, python codes and a detailed README file that outlines the project's goals, requirements, and implementation details. Overall, this project was a significant achievement and a valuable learning experience in the field of computer science and electronics engineering.
